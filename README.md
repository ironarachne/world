# World Generator

This is a tool and library to procedurally generate fantasy worlds.

The API runs on port 7531.

## Configuration

The following environment variables configure the API and are required:

* `WORLDAPI_DATA_DIRECTORY`: The absolute directory that contains data files for the application.
* `WORLDAPI_SAVE_DIRECTORY`: The absolute directory where files will be written to.
* `WORLDAPI_SAVE_TARGET`: Either `DO` to save to Digital Ocean or `filesystem` to save to the local file system.
* `WORLDAPI_WEB_DOMAIN`: The domain name (without protocol) the API serves on. For example, `www.worldapi.com`.

## Building

Run `./build.sh`. The binary will be `dist/worldapi`.

## Running in Development

Run `./run.sh`. It will set sane defaults and use the local filesystem for saving files.
